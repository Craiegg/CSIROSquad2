Elemental nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless and mostly inert diatomic gas at standard conditions, constituting 78.08% by volume of Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe element nitrogen was discovered by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Nitrogen occurs in all living organisms. It is a constituent element of amino acids and thus of proteins, and of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). It resides in the chemical structure of almost all neurotransmitters, and is a defining component of alkaloids, biological molecules produced by many organisms.\n\nMany important industrial compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong bond in elemental nitrogen dominates nitrogen chemistry, causing difficulty for both organisms and industry in breaking the bond to convert the N2  into useful compounds, but releasing large amounts of often useful energy, when these compounds burn, explode, or decay back into nitrogen gas  (Wikipedia.org, 2010)."]},{"label":"Nitrogen","definition":["Defines the concentration of N2 in the air"]},{"label":"Nitrogen"},{"label":"nitrogen(.)"},{"label":"nitrogen(.)","definition":["A monoatomic nitrogen that has formula N."]},{"label":"Nitrogen index (nitrogen washout)"},{"label":"Nitrogen AND/OR nitrogen compound"},{"label":"Nitrogen AND/OR nitrogen compound"},{"label":"Nitrogen Compounds","definition":["Inorganic compounds that contain nitrogen as an integral part of the molecule."]},{"label":"Nitrogen-13"},{"label":"nitrogen tetroxide"},{"label":"Nitrogen-15"},{"label":"nitrogen trioxide"},{"label":"Nitrogen Isotopes","definition":["Stable nitrogen atoms that have the same atomic number as the element nitrogen, but differ in atomic weight.
